  You can do what you want with the code as long as you provide attribution back to me and donâ€™t hold me liable!
  
  This is an example of using the MQTT javascript library, websockets and chrome extensions.
  
  This extension will connect to a MQTT broker using websockets and then subscribe to a topic. 
  When a message is received it will then display the notification using chrome's built-in notifications function.
  
  Requires "notifications" permission.

*Screenshot of what the notification looks like.*
*(Note: the messagebox in bottom right and also the connection icon near the address bar, this will change color 
if the connection is lost.)*

##Installation;
1. download all the files to a directory.
2. edit the background.js file and change the three variables **broker, broker port and topic**
3. in chrome, goto tools -> extenstions
4. tick the 'developer mode' box, then click 'load unpacked extension'
5. select the directory where you have download and edited the extension
6. it should automatically connect!

*Screenshot shows where the options are to install the extension in developer mode.*

##Optional;
If you want you can send a JSON formated payload to the topic you are subscribing too, it has to be sent in this format;

    { "sub": "", "txt": "", "img": ""}
    sub = subject
    txt = message body (NOTE: if you can put a web url in here as well!!)
    img = imagefile location in the thumbnails directory of this extension, example try alert.png
      
example message to send to your broker; (clicking on the notification will open the URL in a new tab)

    {"sub": "thanks for trying mqtt2chrome","txt":"Check out more at http://twitter.com/bordignon","img":"alert.png"}

##Todo/fix;
  * fix the notification history so you can open older ones. 
  * add the settings to another page, so you don't have to edit this page
